# 🏥 RosterAI

**Smart shift allocation system for doctors** — An AI-powered tool that fairly distributes on-call duties based on a points system, while respecting leave requests and call preferences.

## 🔴 The Problem

Currently, hospital shift allocation is a painful manual process:

1. **Doctors** indicate their availability by coloring cells on a shared spreadsheet (AL, CB, etc.)
2. **The "Roster Monster"** (a designated person) manually creates the schedule, trying to:
   - Ensure fair distribution of calls
   - Respect everyone's leave requests
   - Balance weekend duties
   - Maintain minimum staffing per team
3. This takes **hours of work** each month and often results in disputes over fairness

**RosterAI automates this entire process** — doctors input their preferences, and the AI generates a fair roster in seconds.

## 💡 Leave Maximization Strategy

The smart way to maximize your time off:

```
Thursday: Call Request (CR)
   ↓
Friday: Work until 8am-12pm, then Post-Call (PC)
   ↓
Saturday & Sunday: Call Block (CB)
   ↓
Monday onwards: Annual Leave (AL)
   
= Maximum consecutive days off! 🎉
```
